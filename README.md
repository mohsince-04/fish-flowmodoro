This project was inspired by the terminal productivity workflows shown in this  [video](https://youtu.be/GfQjJBtO-8Y?si=j3YaV0F1K6qyR5LK) and their amazing [`.zshrc`](https://gist.github.com/bashbunni/3880e4194e3f800c4c494de286ebc1d7). I decided to make my own version with some new ideas and custom touches!
